## Project Description
CUNY students often rely on student-made WhatsApp group chats for communication, class updates, and collaboration. However, these chats are created inconsistently. If no student takes initiative, then no group chat exists, leaving students disconnected and without an easy way to share resources or support each other.  

**ClassConnect** solves this problem by automatically generating a class group chat for each course. When students enroll in a class, they will receive an invite to join the chat. Students can choose whether to join, ensuring that every course has a consistent communication option without depending on individuals to create it.  

## Key Features
- Automatic creation of class chats for each enrolled course  
- Secure access through CUNY login (only enrolled students can join)  
- Invitation system allowing students to opt-in to chats
